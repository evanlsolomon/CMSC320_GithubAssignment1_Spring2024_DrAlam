Prompt: Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

Answer:

I am taking 320 because I want to be better prepared for the upper level machine learning courses.

I hope that we will review the linear algebra and statistics concepts that are expected knowledge for the more advanced machine/deep learning courses.
